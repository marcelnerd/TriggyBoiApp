# TriggyBoiApp

Author and Creator: Damien Q
This Android app is a trigonometry helper. Given parts of a triangle (right or non-right), it can solve for all the other parts possible.

Anyone is free to take this code and improve it, mess around with it, or sell it if you want.
I'm sure this idea has been done a hundred times before, but if you to improve it, fork it and go crazy. Submit a pull request
and a bug report or two. Don't be shy.

The app has no external dependencies other than Java (obviously). If you're going to import it, I would recommend using Android Studio. If not, Eclipse. Or if you want to be a real man, just copy and paste everything and open this badboy in vim.
